If you're cool, you can skip the first step (seriously!).\r\n\r\n1.

In your HTML document, include this in your header:\r\n```javascript\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/jquery.markdown.css\" type=\"text/css\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Insert this to where you want the editor\r\n```javascript\r\n<div id=\"markdown-editor\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Then insert this in your footer.\r\n```javascript\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"css/jquery.markdown.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n  var instance = $(\"#markdown-editor\").markdown({ editable: true });\r\n  // instance is now the post-instance API.\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Your now successfully installed!\r\n\r\n## Advanced\r\nThis plugin boasts a powerful, extensive API (in two forms: pre-and-post instance) for full control.\r\n\r\n#### Pre-instance API\r\nThe settings you can load when initializing the .markdown() instance are:\r\n* `[class_name]`           -- This allows you to customize the styling of each Markdown instance.\r\n* `[textarea_name]`        -- This allows you to set the name of the textarea which posts raw Markdown.\r\n* `[focus]`                -- Whether the editor should be in focus on loading.\r\n* `[spellcheck]`           -- Whether you wish to enable HTML5's native spellcheck feature.\r\n* `[editable]`             -- Should the editor be editable? This can be enabled at anytime using the post-instance API.\r\n* `[text]`                 -- Any Markdown you wish to load? Highly recommended over others.\r\n* `[onload]`               -- Run an anonymous or named function when instance is fully loaded.\r\n* `[onchange]`             -- Run an anonymous or named function when text is changed.\r\n* `[development]`          -- Active our unstable features? Only for those playing about with the code.\r\n\r\n#### Post-instance API\r\nThe functions you can call under \"instance\" or whatever your variable is (i.e. `instance.development(true)`) are:\r\n* `.development(true|false)`     -- This enables/disables the unstable features.\r\n* `.editable(true|false)`        -- This enables/disables whether you can edit on the editor.\r\n* `.focus()`                     -- This places focus on the editor.\r\n* `.parse()`                     -- Manually parse. If you changed the content via jQuery (and not the library), use this to parse.\r\n* `.spellcheck(true|false)`      -- This enables/disables the native HTML5 spellcheck functionality.\r\n* `.text(\"# Hello world\")`       -- This changes the Markdown text in the editor (and re-parses). New line split by `\\n`.\r\n* `.version()`                   -- This shows the jquery.markdown version number of the instance.\r\n* `.unbind()`                    -- This unbinds the jquery.markdown library to this object.\r\n\r\n\r\n## About\r\nThis plugin was happily developed by Bilawal Hameed, a hacker and entrepreneur. I hated two editors for one piece of text, so I experimented with HTML5 to come up with this hack. Ideally, it should improve into one great piece of kit for websites who care about UI.\r\n\r\nIt's not ready for production yet. It doesn't support the complete [John Gruber Markdown specification](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) as of yet. It's a hack over a couple of hours, and I felt that it would improve faster by releasing it in the wild.\r\n\r\nPlay about with it & let me know what you think.
